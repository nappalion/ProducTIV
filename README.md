# ProducTIV

**ProducTIV** is a goal-setting app that helps promote productivity using a Pomodoro and coin reward system. I wanted a productivity app that combined all the features that I loved 
from other apps into one. It features fun customizability, clear goal making, a timer with pause/play functionality, and a calendar for viewing progress.
